# What is Authentication?<a name="auth_access_what-is-authentication"></a>

Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your credentials\.

**Note**  
To get started quickly, you can ignore this page\. First, review the introductory information on [Authentication and Access Control for AWS RoboMaker](auth-and-access-control.md) and then see [Getting Started with IAM](auth_access_getting-started.md)\.

As a principal, you must be *authenticated* \(signed in to AWS\) using an entity \(root user, IAM user, or IAM role\) to send a request to AWS\. An IAM user can have long\-term credentials such as a user name and password or a set of access keys\. When you assume an IAM role, you are given temporary security credentials\. 

To authenticate from the AWS Management Console as a user, you must sign in with your user name and password\. To authenticate from the AWS CLI or AWS API, you must provide your access key and secret key or temporary credentials\. AWS provides SDK and CLI tools to cryptographically sign your request using your credentials\. If you don’t use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself\. Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might also be required to provide additional security information\. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) to increase the security of your account\.

As a principal, you can sign in to AWS using the following entities \(users or roles\):
+ **AWS account root user** –  When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones\. Instead, adhere to the [best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users)\. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks\. 
+ **IAM user** – An [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions\. AWS RoboMaker supports *Signature Version 4*, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests\. For more information about authenticating requests, see [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
+ **IAM role** –  An [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions\. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS\. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it\. Also, a role does not have standard long\-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it\. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session\. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:
  + **Federated user access** –  Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider\. These are known as *federated users*\. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an [identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html)\. For more information about federated users, see [Federated users and roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_access-management.html#intro-access-roles) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 
  + **Temporary user permissions** – An IAM user can assume a role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task\. 
  + **Cross\-account access** – You can use an IAM role to allow a trusted principal in a different account to access resources in your account\. Roles are the primary way to grant cross\-account access\. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource \(instead of using a role as a proxy\)\. AWS RoboMaker does not support these resource\-based policies\. For more information about choosing whether to use a role or a resource\-based policy to allow cross\-account access, see [Controlling Access to Principals in a Different Account](auth_access_what-is-access-control.md#auth_access_controlling-principal-accounts)\.
  + **AWS service access** –  A service role is an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf\. Service roles provide access only within your account and cannot be used to grant access to services in other accounts\. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM\. For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 
  + **Applications running on Amazon EC2** –  You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests\. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance\. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance\. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials\. For more information, see [Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
